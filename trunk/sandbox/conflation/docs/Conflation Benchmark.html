When I first heard the word <bold>conflation</bold>, my
first thought was wtf, is that word made up? In the context I heard it, the term related to
maintaining an up-to-date and coherent view of data for financial
securities (such as a stocks or indexes). I thought the following
definition from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conflation">Wiktionary</a>
was good:
<blockquote>"A blend or fusion, esp. a composite reading or text
formed by combining the material of two or more texts into a single
text."
</blockquote>
In this post I publish some findings on a few different implementations of simple in-process conflation systems.&nbsp;<br><br>As an example, we need to maintain an up-to-date view of a Price
object:<br><br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public interface Price {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long getId();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long getVersion();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double getBid();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double getAsk();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double getLast();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long getVolume();<br>}</pre>
